The frontend of the e-commerce website's admin module is built using vanilla JavaScript. It provides a responsive and interactive user interface for administrators to manage various aspects of the website. Here's an overview of the frontend functionalities:

1. User Management: The admin can view a list of all admins and their details. They can also register a new admin by providing the necessary information.

2. Seller Verification: The admin can view a list of seller registrations and their details. They have the ability to update the verification status of sellers, marking them as verified or unverified.

3. Business Growth Tracking: The admin can view a graphical representation of the business growth data, such as sales revenue or user activity, for different years. They can also add new data points to track the business's growth over time.

4. Customer Registration Management: The admin can view a list of customer registrations and their details. They have the option to delete a customer registration if necessary.

5. Product Management: The admin can view a list of products available on the website. They can delete a product from the list if required.

6. Order Tracking: The admin can view a list of orders placed by customers. They have the ability to delete an order if needed.

The frontend interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with interactive elements such as tables, forms, buttons, and graphical charts. It leverages JavaScript's capabilities to handle dynamic content loading, form validation, and asynchronous communication with the backend API.

The frontend communicates with the backend server through RESTful API endpoints, making HTTP requests to retrieve data, send updates, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The responses from the server are processed using JavaScript, and the interface is updated dynamically to reflect the changes.

Overall, the frontend built with vanilla JavaScript provides a seamless and efficient user experience for administrators, allowing them to manage different aspects of the e-commerce website easily.
